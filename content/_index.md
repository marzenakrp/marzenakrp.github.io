I am currently a senior researcher at Microsoft. I did my postdoc at the [Manning College of Information & Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/), University of Massachusetts Amherst working with [Prof. Mohit Iyyer](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/).

I am interested in **how well natural language processing (NLP) systems handle long-form content**, both as input and output. My work includes areas like machine translation of creative texts, story generation, summarizing long texts, verifying claims about book-length content, and multilingual long-form question answering. I am also interested in exploring how modern language models can assist professionals such as writers or literary translators.

I hold a Ph.D. from the [Department of Language and Information Sciences](https://www.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eng_site/info/academics/grad/lis/) at the University of Tokyo.
