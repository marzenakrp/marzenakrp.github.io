LitMT is a specialized machine translation system designed specifically for literary texts. Unlike conventional MT systems that focus on linguistic accuracy, LitMT prioritizes the preservation of stylistic elements, metaphors, cultural references, and the author's unique voice.

## Key Features

- Style-aware translation mechanisms
- Preservation of rhetorical devices and metaphors
- Cultural adaptation capabilities
- Support for poetry, prose, and dramatic works
- Human-in-the-loop refinement options

LitMT represents a significant advancement in applying machine translation to creative works, addressing the unique challenges posed by literary translation where meaning extends beyond the literal interpretation of words.
