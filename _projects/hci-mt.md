    HCI-MT: Enhancing the collaboration between human translators and machine translation systems.
</div>

The HCI-MT project investigates novel interaction paradigms between human translators and machine translation systems. By designing intuitive interfaces and interaction patterns, this research aims to optimize the translation workflow, combining the creativity and cultural awareness of human translators with the efficiency of machine translation.

## Key Features

- Ergonomic interfaces for translation revision
- Real-time suggestion systems
- Adaptive learning from translator corrections
- Context-aware translation options
- Cognitive load reduction techniques
- Customizable workspace configurations

This research contributes to both the fields of human-computer interaction and translation studies, developing evidence-based approaches to interface design for professional translators working with machine translation tools.
